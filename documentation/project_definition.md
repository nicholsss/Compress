# Project definition

The aim of the project is to implement several lossless compression algorithms including Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv using Java. Depending on the contents of a file, the target compression rate is anywhere between 20 and 90 percent. It should also be possible to decompress the files without any loss of information.

## Algorithms and data structrures

Huffman coding utilizes a tree. Lempel-Ziv encoding can utilize suffix trees or suffix arrays. 

## Input and output

The input is any file and the output is a file that is hopefully substantially smaller.
