# Progress Report: Week 2

This week I started on the implementation of Huffman coding. At the moment it handles only string input and outputs a representation of the coded bits as a string. The next thing to do is to make a generic version that handles input as a bytestream. I also need to replace the Java standard library PriorityQueue with my own implementation.

Time spent: 8h
